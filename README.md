# Parts
A project to practice performing data analysis.

## Introduction 
As part of my course, I was tasked with creating a schema that showed parts sold and their suppliers.
We were then tasked to answer questions based on the schema.

### Task 
* Build a schema. Include a table for parts, projects, and suppliers.
* Answer varied analytical questions on the data- utilise joins and nested joins
* Additionally, create a function, procedure, trigger, and event.


## Takeaways
I enjoyed this project. It was quite the task having to utilise complex joins but it was worth it in the end as I got to the answer.
